<!--
-p tag (parapragh) formats makes a new line and groups text into a paragraph
-em (emphasis) and i (italicize) tags both italicize but use em tag because html is about structure not styling
-same with b (bold) tag and strong tag, use strong instead of b because it conmfers meaning, says this text is important
-ul tag (unordered list) makes a bullet list
-li tag (list item) goes inside ul element and encloses each bullet point
-ol tag (ordered list) makes a numbered list of li elements
-can nest lists within lists, ordered or unordered, can also number with roman numerals or start at a number
-img tag (<img src="ahmed.png" alt="">) is a self closing tag, must specify source, can be internet url or local image
 in same directory as website, the alt tag will display text if the site cant render the image, helps with SEO too 
 benefit of having image in path is not relying on other websites/servers to download and display it, must specify
 path if image is not on the same level
-a tag (anchor tag) (<a href 4="http..."><Linked_text</a>) hyperlinks text, href is the hyperlink dest, can be another
  website or another html page 
-table tage adds excel style data to page
-tr tag (table row) makes a new row in the table
-td tag (table data) makes a new cell in that row
-tables have header, body, and footer sections like html sites, dont have to structure like this but useful for other 
 customization where need to isolate table header and body (ex scrolling through table but heading doesnt move)
-th is a table header, titles for the rows of the tables
-HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JS for behavior, though can style in HTML use CSS for that
-can also use tables to affect structure of HTML (ex profile pic on left, name on right)
-border attribute adds a border to table, cell spacing attribute adds distance between cells
-use Win+. to type emoji with emoji keyboard
-can nest tables to maker certain layouts
-form tag to make forms, just by itself doesnt do anything, within it can place label and input tags,
 label tag displays information on the form and input tag (<input type="text">) holds input, input tag
 can do many different things based on its type. ex: text/checkbox/submit/color/password/file/date/range
 each displays a different element on the form, text area tag makes a textbox in the form, rows and column
 determine size of the textbox, user can drag to change size of textbox but default chosen by the developer
 action element in form tag chooses what happens when you click submit, can send user back to homepage or
 email the input using mailto, mailto opens default email client using the email provided, method element
 set to post just puts all the info entered into form by user into the email, enctype element sets the encoding
 type to be used in the forms data that is transferred to the email, name attribute in input tags show what each
 data is referring to when form data is put into the email
